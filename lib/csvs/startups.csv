Advanced Science And Automation Corp,http://www.ascience.com,"Advanced Science And Automation Corp is a company that received a STTR Phase II grant for a project entitled: Advanced Virtual Manufacturing Lab for Research, Training, and Education. Their project proposes the creation of an Advanced Virtual Manufacturing Lab (AVML) for training and education on high-tech CNC machines. The key elements of the AVML are: (a) textured 3D photo-realistic virtual models of the machines and lab that include the machines' controls and moving parts; (b) semi-empirical model of the machining operation; (c) hierarchical knowledge-base for process training; (d) unstructured knowledge-base for lecture delivery; (e) natural-language human-like intelligent virtual tutors. In this phase of the research, the AVML will be completed by adding more capabilities, including 5-axis milling and collision detection between the tool and the machine, and enhancing the accuracy and completeness of the machining operation model. Furthermore, the AVML will be enhanced by incorporating Conversational Programming, different types of machine controllers, and two additional types of machines: CNC lathe and production-grade 5-axes milling machine. Pilot implementations will be conducted at a university and two community colleges. Applications of AVML include: training students to operate manufacturing machines in a safe environment, allowing students and researchers to view and interact with a near-physically accurate simulation of manufacturing machines, and optimization of the manufacturing process plan by testing various plans on the virtual machine before machining on the physical machine. Manufacturing drives innovation and is a powerful engine of economic growth. However, US manufacturers face a shortage of workers to run tomorrow's factories. The AVML will enhance the quality, accessibility, and productivity of manufacturing education and training and will advance scientific discovery and engineering analysis of manufacturing processes. Also, The AVML will enhance experimentation and learning, increase student creativity and problem-solving capability, enhance collaboration among students, teachers, and industry experts, and promote participation and equal access of underrepresented groups to manufacturing technology training. Most potential manufacturing workers do not have access to state-of-the-art manufacturing labs that can provide the required training. The AVML will enable such access. This success, in turn, will strengthen US manufacturers' competitiveness and further important US national interests.   Advanced Science And Automation Corp is a company that received a SBIR Phase II grant for a project entitled: Virtual Learning Environment for University Physics. Their project proposes the development of a web-based collaborative Virtual Learning Environment for teaching freshman university physics, called the Virtual Physics Lab (VPL). The VPL will deliver an individualized self-paced learning experience using high-end multimedia lectures, and interactive virtual-reality simulations. The multimedia lectures are delivered using a synchronized multimodal combination of both highlighted text and speech that is delivered by near-photorealistic intelligent animated virtual instructors. The multimedia lectures include interactive Flash animations, movies, and 2D/3D animated illustrations. The VPL's interactive simulations are delivered in a video-game-like 3D virtual environment using physics-based models to simulate physics concepts such as pendulums, impact, buoyancy, magnetism etc. The VPL is highly interactive and uses pre-topic, in-topic, and post-topic questions to keep students engaged and to assess whether or not students need further training in any given subject. The VPL also includes collaborative/competitive mini 3D computer games that use relevant physics principles to increase the students' interest about the material being taught, and to add entertainment and competitive dimensions to the learning experience. The VPL's interactivity and the visually stimulating instruction will result in faster assimilation, deeper understanding, and higher memory retention by the students than traditional text-book/classroom learning. The VPL has the potential to radically change the way physics is taught. Due to the current exponential rate of increase in human scientific and technical knowledge, there is a need for students to assimilate more knowledge at a faster rate. Current classroom and text-book instruction delivery methods cannot satisfy this need due to a variety of reasons, including, delivery of the lecture in non-engaging and minimally interactive way, use of antiquated static graphical illustrations, variability of teacher skill, lack of one-on-one teacher attention, and variability of student learning styles and speeds. The VPL will help overcome those limitations. Particularly, it will enhance the quality, accessibility, and speed of learning. It will enhance the student experimentation, creativity and problem-solving capability. Freshman university physics was chosen because it is one of the essential foundations for training high-caliber engineers and scientists who will ensure the continued leadership of the US in developing new technologies and in conducting cutting-edge scientific research. The US market for the proposed learning tool is estimated at 500,000 licenses per year. A larger market exists worldwide in English language speaking countries, and for future versions of the VPL that will be translated into other languages.   Advanced Science And Automation Corp is a company that received a SBIR Phase I grant for a project entitled: Virtual Learning Environment for University Physics. Their research project proposes developing an advanced web-based collaborative virtual learning environment (VLE) for teaching freshman university physics. The VLE will deliver self-paced compelling and engaging instruction in the form of interactive simulations and high-end multimedia lectures. The interactive simulations will be delivered in a video-game-like 3D virtual environment, that supports multi-users, using physics-based models. The instruction will be delivered by near-photorealistic intelligent animated virtual instructors who can answer natural language questions. The multimedia lectures will include synchronized speech, text, sounds, movies and 2D/3D animated illustrations. At the end of each section, the student will be offered test exercises that he/she can either do on his/her own or with guidance from the virtual instructor. The VLE will include the subjects covered in first year university physics including, kinematics, Newtonian mechanics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity & magnetism, optics, relativity and quantum/particle physics. In Phase I, a prototype VLE which includes a subset of those subjects (about 20% of a typical first-year physics text book) will be developed. The VLE's interactivity and high level of visual/audio quality will result in faster assimilation, deeper understanding, and higher memory retention by the students than traditional text-book/classroom learning. The proposed university physics VLE has the potential to radically change the way physics is taught. Due to the current exponential rate of increase in human scientific and technical knowledge, there is a need for students in science and engineering fields to assimilate more knowledge at a faster rate. Current classroom and text-book instruction delivery methods cannot satisfy these needs due to a variety of reasons, including, delivery of the lecture in non-engaging and minimally interactive way, use of antiquated static graphical illustrations, variability of teacher skill, lack of one-on-one teacher attention, and variability of student learning styles and speeds. The VLE will help overcome those limitations. Particularly, it will enhance the quality, accessibility, and speed of learning. It will also enhance the student experimentation, creativity and problem-solving capability. Freshman university physics was chosen in this project because it is one of the essential foundations for training high-caliber engineers and scientists who will ensure the continued leadership of the US in developing new technologies and in conducting cutting-edge scientific research. The VLE framework can be applied to other fields including mathematics, chemistry and biology. It can also be applied to K-12 courses.",1.16,Internet,Internet Software & Services,Education & Training,United States,Indiana,Indianapolis,,Grant - II,3/9/2009,0.51
